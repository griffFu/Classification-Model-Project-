# Classification-Model-Project-
In this project, we trained multiple classification models to predict if tweets came from the democratic or republican platform. We then deployed this model onto the twitters of senators and observed the accuracy.


Main Results from this project. 
1. Found that BERT as a classificaiton model was able to get up to 93% accuracy using a 70-30 split of the training and test set.
2. Significant relationship between senator accuracy rate and number of followers, margin of victory, years in office, and average number of tweets per week.
